This repository contains the example code for our paper: 

**[Remote Monitoring of Water Clarity in Coastal Oceans of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, China based on Machine Learning](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2024.111789), Ecological Indicators, Volume 160, 2024**

We also provide a [colab notebook](./Acolite_Notebook/Acolite-GEE-Colab.ipynb) to run [acolite](https://github.com/acolite/acolite) on Google Earth Engine commonly.

## Notebooks
- `Acolite-GEE-Demo.ipynb` is an example colab notebook to apply our proposed model to GEE application.

- `Acolite_Notebook/Acolite-GEE-Colab.ipynb` is a colab notebook to run [acolite](https://github.com/acolite/acolite) commonly.
